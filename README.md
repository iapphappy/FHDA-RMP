# Rate-My-Professor-Extension

This Google Chrome extension uses the Rate My Professor API to request information about each professor on the BYU registration page.  It retrieves the information based on the professor's name.  No information will be shown if the professor's name is misspelled or absent from the Rate My Professor database.

A rating will be added to the table of professors that links to that professor's rating page on ratemyprofessor.com.  When the user places his/her mouse over the rating, a tooltip is generated with more information, so that the user does not need to click the link unless they want more details.

I used the Tooltipster JQuery Plugin to help generate the tooltips.
